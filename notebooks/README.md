# README.md `notebooks`

The `notebooks` folder might contain examples of [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) or [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notebooks. These notebook formats are powerful, dynamic documents that interleave code and text. They can be very useful for:

- working through problems as a kind of "sketchpad"
  - the interactive nature of the document means that you can experiment with code and analyses quickly
- reusing ideas and analyses with new datasets
  - supporting _reusability_ and _reproducibility_
- presenting interactive analyses with dynamic widgets
  - enabling a reader to explore the data with no need for detailed technical knowledge

- mixing richly formatted text with code and output, and to save documents in other formats (e.g. `.pdf` and `.html`) 
  - enables _sharing_ with others and rapid publication
  - presenting analyses elegantly in a static way
  - writing webpages showing your work and analysis
  - host supplementary material online that is too large or cumbersome to include in a report or thesis
  - presenting the entire analysis or thesis in an interactive book form

Notebooks can be organised in many different ways: one subfolder per kind of notebook; a different subfolder for each topic addressed; no subfolders; and so on.

## Making a notebook available as a webpage in GitHub Pages

1. Save the `notebook` in `.html` format
2. Add and commit the `.html` pages to the GitHub repository
3. Add a link in the main landing `README.md` file or from another intersitital webpage to the HTML page built by GitHub Pages.
